# Preface

Just a few years ago, there were no legions of deep learning scientists
developing intelligent products and services at major companies and startups.
When the youngest of us (the authors) entered the field,
machine learning didn't command headlines in daily newspapers.
Our parents had no idea what machine learning was,
let alone why we might prefer it to a career in medicine or law.
Machine learning was a forward-looking academic discipline
with a narrow set of real-world applications.
And those applications, e.g. speech recognition and computer vision,
required so much domain knowledge that they were often regarded
as separate areas entirely for which machine learning was one small component.
Neural networks, the antecedents of the deep learning models
that we focus on in this book, were regarded as outmoded tools.


In just the past five years, deep learning has taken the world by surprise,
driving rapid progress in fields as diverse as computer vision,
natural language processing, automatic speech recognition,
reinforcement learning, and statistical modeling.
With these advances in hand, we can now build cars that drive themselves
(with increasing autonomy), smart reply systems that anticipate mundane replies,
helping people dig out from mountains of email,
and software agents that dominate the world's best humans at board games like Go,
a feat once deemed to be decades away.
Already, these tools are exerting a widening impact,
changing the way movies are made, diseases are diagnosed,
and playing a growing role in basic sciences -- from astrophysics to biology.
This book represents our attempt to make deep learning approachable,
teaching you both the *concepts*, the *context*, and the *code*.
