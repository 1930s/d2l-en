## Summary
* Deep learning has revolutionized pattern recognition, introducing technology that now powers a wide range of  technologies, including computer vision, natural language processing, automatic speech recognition.
* To successfully apply deep learning, you must understand how to cast a problem, the mathematics of modeling, the algorithms for fitting your models to data, and the engineering techniques to implement it all.
* This book presents a comprehensive resource, including prose, figures, mathematics, and code, all in one place.
* To answer questions related to this book, visit our forum at https://discuss.mxnet.io/.
* Apache MXNet is a powerful library for coding up deep learning models and unning them in parallel across GPU cores.
* Gluon is a high level library that makes it easy to code up deep learning models using Apache MXNet.
* Conda is a Python package manager that ensures that all software dependencies are met.
* All notebooks are available for download on GitHub and  the conda configurations needed to run this book's code are expressed in the `environment.yml` file.
* If you plan to run this code on GPUs, don't forget to install the necessary drivers and update your configuration.
